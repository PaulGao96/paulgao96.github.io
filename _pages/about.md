Hello, I am Kaihui, a second-year PhD student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. This is the homepage of my [lab](https://nasp.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). Meanwhile, I am working as an academic intern in Alibaba Group's network research team for research and development. I have broad interest in networking and systems, including **intelligent network**, **network visualization in data center**, etc. Currently, I am focusing on using In-band Network Telemetry to diagnose and improve the performance of distributed applications.
