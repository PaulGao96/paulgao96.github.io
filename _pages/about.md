I am currently an Assistant Researcher at Zhongguancun Laboratory.
I received my Ph.D. in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, in 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Dan Li](https://nasp.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lidan.html).  
I have broad interest in networking and systems, including **programmable network**, **intelligent network**, **Digital Twin Network**, etc. Currently, I am focusing on using programmable dataplane to improve and guarantee the performance of DCN.
