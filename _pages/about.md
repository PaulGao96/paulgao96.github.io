Hello, I am Kaihui, a fourth-year PhD student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. This is the homepage of my [lab](https://nasp.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). Meanwhile, I am working as an academic intern in Alibaba Group's network research team. I have broad interest in networking and systems, including **intelligent network**, **programmable network in data center**, etc. Currently, I am focusing on using programmable dataplane to diagnose and improve the performance of DCN.
