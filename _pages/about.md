Hello, I am Kaihui, a fourth-year PhD student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Dan Li](https://nasp.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lidan.html). Meanwhile, I am working as an academic intern in Alibaba Group's network research team. I have broad interest in networking and systems, including **programmable network**, **intelligent network**, etc. Currently, I am focusing on using programmable dataplane to diagnose and improve the performance of DCN.
